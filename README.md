# Breakeven-Analysis-Calculator
Wrote a Program in MATLAB that calculated breakeven analysis for the construction of a zoo and calculates the breakeven point for the same for different types of materials.
It calculated a time in months for the zoo to recover the costs of constructions with different kinds of construction materials. It also plots a graph which gives the viewer a pictorial representation of at what point in time will they recover their capital investment.
